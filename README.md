#Tidy Tabs for Sublime Text

*Note: Sublime Text 3 beta now supported!*

Ever get to the end (middle?) of a day of coding only to find your window littered with tabs that are nearly impossible to search through visually? Find yourself rage-quitting all your tabs in disgust and starting over? No? Just me? Ok.

With this plugin, a simple keystroke `ctrl + alt + w` will close all tabs whose file has not been modified in the last 30 minutes (to change this interval, see Preferences > Packages > TidyTabs > Settings). It will only close tabs in the background â€“ so files that are open and active in your window won't be closed. Likewise, it will not close files with unsaved changes.

You can change the key binding in Preferences > Package Settings > TidyTabs > Key Bindings.

##Run automatically

You can also configure the plugin to automatically close old tabs each time you save a file. To enable this, go to Preferences > Package Settings > TidyTabs > Settings and set `tidytabs_run_on_post_save` to `true`:

~~~js
// Automatically run tidytabs after a file is saved
"tidytabs_run_on_post_save": true,
~~~

##Threshold

Another configuration option is the **threshold**. Setting this to a number greater than 0 will ensure that TidyTabs only runs when the number of tabs in that view is greater than the threshold.

~~~js
// If this is set and greater than 0, tidytabs will only run if
// the number of tabs is greater than the threshold setting.
"tidytabs_threshold": 5
~~~

##Installation with Package Manager (Recommended)

The easiest way to install is via the excellent [Sublime Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation). Once Package Manager is installed, bring up the commands menu (`Command + Shift + P` on Mac, `Control + Shift + P` on Windows or Linux), then type "Package Control" to filter the commands list. Select the "Package Control: Install Package" command, then find and install the TidyTabs plugin.

##Installation without Package Manager
Clone or download this repo to your **Packages** folder.
